# Testing

The mocha-webpack plugin module is used in the project. You can invoke tests locally with these instructions.

### Unit tests:
- `npm run test` (runs unit tests)

- `npm run test:watch` (continually running, if UT files are changed, reruns the tests)  

### Feature tests:
- `npm run ft` (runs feature tests)

- `npm run ft:watch` (continually running, if FT files are changed, reruns the tests)
